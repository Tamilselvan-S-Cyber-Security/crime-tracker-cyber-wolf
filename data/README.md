# Data Directory

This directory stores captured surveillance data. Each capture is stored in a separate directory named with its timestamp.

Structure:
- timestamp_directory/
  - image.jpg
  - audio.wav (if audio was recorded)
  - metadata.json

Note: This directory should be properly secured in a production environment.
